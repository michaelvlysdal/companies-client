# CompaniesClient
Small app that is based on the company ruby api (https://github.com/michaelvlysdal/companies-api-es-cqrs-ruby).

Could use some more testing and polishing, but its just for the fun of it :)

Local environment config expects that you have the company api running on localhost:4567, and prod build points on the heroku released version.

## Getting started
```sh
npm run install
npm run ng serve
```
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.
